SoC
Academic System on Chip based on RISC-V core, developed from scratch.
SoC contains:
- RISC-V in order, 5 stage pipeline core
- Interconnect Wishbone commutator
- RAM, ROM plugs
- IO hub with UART

Target platfrom FPGA Spartan-6.

We introduce assembler for RISC-V ISA, which supports our custom commands.
